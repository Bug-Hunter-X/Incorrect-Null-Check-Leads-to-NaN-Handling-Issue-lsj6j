This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving the loose equality operator (==) and its interaction with null and NaN values. The bug arises from using == to check for null, which fails to correctly identify NaN, leading to unexpected behavior. The solution shows the correct way to handle both null and NaN values using the strict equality operator (===) or a dedicated check for NaN.
